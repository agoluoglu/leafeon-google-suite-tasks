This is a template repository for Python projects. It includes a basic setup for managing dependencies, continuous integration, and directory structure commonly used in Python projects.

## PDM
This repository uses [PDM](https://pdm-project.org/latest/) to manage Python packages and dependencies.  
The configuration can be found in the `pyproject.toml` file. To add or remove dependencies, check the PDM documentation for [managing dependencies](https://pdm-project.org/latest/usage/dependency/).

## Flake8 & Black
This repository uses [Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) linting as its static analysis tool to check the code against various style rules and detect potential issues, such as syntax errors, unused variables, or overly complex code.  
[Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is then used for code formatting.  
To modify rules for tools like flake8 and black, check the configurations under `[tool.flake8]` and `[tool.black]` in the `pyproject.toml` file.

## Pytest
This repository uses [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/8.0.x/) for code testing.  
Pytest is set to run on the `source/tests` directory in the "Run tests" run step of the `.circleci/config.yml` file.

## CircleCI
This repository uses [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) for continuous integration.  
CircleCI will automatically set up python with PDM, install default and development dependencies, run tests with pytest, perform static analysis with flake8, and apply black formatting. To modify these build steps, check the configuration in the `.circleci/config.yml` file.  

## Directory Structure

- `source/`: Contains the main source code.
  - `main.py`: Entry point of the application.
  - `component/`: Contains an example component.
    - `component.py`: Contains an example function `add`.
  - `tests/`: Contains test cases, including a test of component.py.
